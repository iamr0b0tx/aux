# laughing-octo-garbanzo High Level Design (HLD)

The purpose of this document is to discuss a design of a User Interface and experience (UI/UX) for an Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) Application. This is a high level design doc, we would only be exploring solutions here,
implementation details about each solution/idea is not in scope for this doc.

# Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a man made intelligence i.e. recreating human intelligence in machines. Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) is a AI that has general intelligence i.e. intelligence across brad categories or domains.
When AGI is developed, it would require a novel User interface and User experience design, whatever interface or
experience we develop would be the ultimate representation of a Human-Machine Interface.

Before the inevitable development of AGI, we would need to come up with a UI/UX that would allow us to utilize the full
capability of these AGI systems while provide a seamless and intuitive user experience to humans.

# Requirements

Before proposing a possible solution to the problem at hand, we need to highlight different probable AGI-Human
interactions. We also need to specify the affordances that the solution would provide, not just to the humans but also
to the AGI system.

## Functional Requirements

| Capability    | User Story                                                                                                                    | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Search topics | As a student,<br/>I want to search for a topic and get relevant results on that topic,<br/>So that I can complete my homework |       |
|               |                                                                                                                               |       |
|               |                                                                                                                               |       |

## Non Functional Requirements

| Capability            | User Story                                                                                                       | Notes |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 99.9999% Availability | As a user,<br/>I want to be able to use the solution whenever,<br/>So that I can achieve my goals                |       |
| 99.9999% Reliability  | As a user,<br/>I want to be able to trust that the tool is consistent,<br/>So that I always get accurate results |       |
|                       |                                                                                                                  |       |
|                       |                                                                                                                  |       |
